# [Project 1:Analysis of Armory in CS:GO ](https://github.com/sagar2bhujbal/ESPORT)
*AIM  : To find the best features in CS:Go data that can predict win accurately.  
*Idea : One question people always ask to win a team is “Tell us about the winning recipe?”. Is there a secret ingredient? .It’s all started with one simple question. How small decisions players make during a game will have an impact on a game. For example, this idea we will analyze the armory. How small decision like buying a weapon in a particular round has an impact on match or not.  
*EDA  : Cleaned Data and created different visulisations to illutrate the findings.  
*skills: Python, Tableau
